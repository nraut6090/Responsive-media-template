generally when we define width of any element then it will be consider as it's finsl width at that instance
But when we add any padding or border then total-width=width+Padding+border,
Due to this element looks bigger in size irrespective of width we have mentioned
box-sizing:border-box ,allows us to add padding and border to the same width ,
so that width of element remains constant even if we change padding and borderof an element.
